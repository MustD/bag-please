# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 1-6-e2e-test-infrastructure-auth-flow-coverage (2026-05-14)

- Hardcoded admin/admin credentials in test files — documented default dev credentials; swap to env var pattern if
  credentials become environment-specific
- Registration test accumulates test users with no teardown — explicitly accepted in dev notes; clean dev DB
  periodically or add a purge script before prod migration
- `button[aria-haspopup="true"]` selector not scoped to AppBar — stable for current UI; refactor to scoped selector if
  additional `aria-haspopup` buttons are added to the header
- `[aria-label="logout"]` selector fragile to future label/i18n changes — use `data-testid` for logout trigger when
  accessibility labels evolve
- No `webServer` config in playwright.config.ts — out of scope per story; add `webServer` block with `docker compose`
  invocation when CI pipeline is configured
- No `playwright install` step in `test:e2e` script — one-time manual setup; document in CI pipeline onboarding
- No explicit timeout overrides on URL/element assertions — Playwright default (5s) is adequate for local dev; increase
  if flakiness observed in CI

## Deferred from: code review of 1-5-user-identity-account-management-ui (2026-05-11)

- Silent return when `accessToken` is null gives user no feedback — spec-designed loading-window guard; UX improvement
  is post-scope
- UserChip causes layout shift during hydration — AppHeader renders chip once auth context resolves; needs
  skeleton/loading state design
- No client-side check that new password differs from current — server enforced
- No minimum password length client validation — server enforced; depends on backend password policy rules
- Non-wrong-password server errors (401, 500) surfaced under "Current password" field — only AC4 wrong-password case is
  spec'd; general error placement is post-scope design
- No spacing `sx` between UserChip and Navigation icon in Toolbar — no spec requirement; adjust if design calls for it

## Deferred from: code review of 1-4-login-registration-ui (2026-05-11)

- `LoginForm` / `RegisterPage` near-identical components — same layout, state structure, and submit pattern with zero
  shared abstraction; will diverge silently; architectural refactor deferred beyond story scope
- Unsafe `role as 'admin' | 'user'` cast in both `auth/page.tsx` and `register/page.tsx` — unexpected backend role value
  silently accepted; cross-cutting TypeScript concern; deferred as it matches the existing pattern
- `authApi.register` success response JSON parse unguarded — if `res.ok` is true but body is not valid JSON the
  rejection is unhandled; matches existing `authApi.login` behaviour; deferred as cross-cutting API hardening
- `WelcomeBanner` reappears if `username` repopulates after auth expiry while `showBanner` is still `true` — edge case;
  acceptable for v1

## Deferred from: code review of 1-3-frontend-theme-auth-infrastructure (2026-05-09)

- `auth/page.tsx` still calls bare `fetch('/api/login')` + writes `localStorage` — full replacement is story 1.4 scope;
  currently broken but unreachable because RouteGuard redirects to `/auth` (which then fails to populate AuthContext)
- `AuthProvider` refresh failure silently swallowed — `.catch(() => {})` per spec intent; no user-visible error on
  session expiry; consider a toast or redirect with message in a future UX pass
- No inverse guard for authenticated users visiting `/auth` — authenticated users land on the login page; they must
  manually navigate away; add redirect-if-authenticated logic before or during story 1.4 login UI
- `isLoading` stays `true` on `AuthProvider` unmount before refresh resolves — React StrictMode double-invoke in dev
  causes two parallel refresh calls; add `AbortController` cleanup to the `useEffect` as a hardening step

## Deferred from: code review of 1-2-login-token-system-session-security-backend (2026-05-08)

- Admin timing attack — plain-text `==` on admin password is faster than bcrypt+DB; spec intentionally chose this;
  timing side-channel exists but is an accepted design trade-off
- Admin password in JVM heap — config-sourced String not zeroed; general JVM concern; not actionable without moving to
  char[]
- Refresh tokens stored as plaintext in MongoDB — should hash with SHA-256 before storing; DB exfiltration exposes all
  active sessions; security hardening deferred
- Access token not revoked on password change — 15-min JWTs stay valid after change-password; requires a token blocklist
  to fix; known JWT architecture limitation
- Admin timing leak vs regular user — admin check bypasses bcrypt+DB; ~100ms timing difference reveals admin account;
  inherent in plain-text design choice
- No `iat` (issued-at) claim in JWT — prevents "invalidate tokens issued before T" without a blocklist; security
  hardening
- `UserStorage.sync()` check-then-act race — `synced` flag is not atomically guarded; double-sync possible under
  coroutine concurrency; pre-existing in storage layer
- CORS plugin does not allow credentials or expose Authorization header — frontend is same-origin via nginx;
  cross-origin clients (API playground, mobile) will fail; pre-existing config
- MongoDB error handling absent in repositories — `insertOne`/`deleteOne` throw MongoWriteException as 500; pre-existing
  pattern across all repositories; needs global error handler
- AC2 log sanitization — Ktor monitoring may log request bodies including credentials; audit `configureMonitoring()`
  before production; flagged in Story 1.1 deferred items

## Deferred from: code review of 1-1-user-entity-registration-backend (2026-05-08)

- No input validation on username/password (length, blank, character set) — out of scope for Story 1.1; consider a
  validation layer before Story 1.4 login UI
- BCrypt 72-byte password truncation — passwords longer than 72 bytes are silently truncated by BCrypt; no max length
  enforced at API boundary; security hardening out of scope
- `password.toCharArray()` not zeroed after hashing — not actionable in JVM given the upstream `String` is also
  unzeroable
- `role` field is raw String, not typed enum — design concern; consider converting to `enum class Role` when more roles
  are added
- `UserRepository.findByUsername` is dead code — storage intentionally serves from memory only; the repository method
  exists for potential future direct-DB lookup but is currently never called
- No test for malformed / empty JSON request body — `call.receive<RegisterRequest>()` throws on bad input; behavior
  untested; out of scope for this story
- No test verifies bcrypt hash stored in MongoDB — test only checks HTTP response doesn't contain plaintext; would
  require direct DB access against project testing policy
- UUID deserialization byte-swap risk — `UUIDMongoSerializer.asUuid()` may use JAVA_LEGACY byte order vs STANDARD used
  by `MongoClientSettings`; needs cross-cutting investigation against existing ItemRepository to confirm consistency
- Rate limiter coverage of `/auth/login` — `RateLimitName("auth")` is already reusable; Story 1.2 just wraps
  `/auth/login` in `rateLimit(RateLimitName("auth"))`; no structural refactor needed
- Monitoring plugin may log request bodies including passwords — pre-existing concern not introduced by Story 1.1; audit
  `configureMonitoring()` before production deployment
